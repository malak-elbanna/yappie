## ADR: Decision to Use AWS S3 and Firebase for Storage
## Context
Our platform needs a reliable way to store and serve large amounts of audiobook and podcast content. The storage system must be scalable, and capable of handling high user traffic. Additionally, it should support fast access and integration with our backend services.

## Decision
We chose AWS S3 as our primary storage solution and Firebase Storage as a secondary option, mainly for mobile users.

## Justification
- **Scalability:** AWS S3 can store as much data as we need and handle a lot of users at the same time without slowing down.  
- **Reliability:** Our files are stored in multiple locations, so even if something goes wrong in one place, we don’t lose data.  
- **Easy Integration:** AWS S3 works well with our backend and supports CDN caching, which makes content load faster for users.  
- **Why Firebase Storage?** It’s great for mobile users because it’s optimized for real-time access and comes with built-in authentication, making things simpler.

## Consequences
## Pros:
High Availability: Ensures data is always accessible, even if one storage node fails.

Security: Supports encryption and access control, preventing unauthorized access.

Global Access: Allows users to stream content from anywhere with minimal delay.

## Cons:
Latency for Large Files: AWS S3 might introduce slight delays for large file retrievals unless optimized.

Storage Costs: Expenses increase as more content is uploaded, requiring cost monitoring.

Firebase Limitations: Firebase has storage limits and might not be as cost-effective for high-bandwidth use cases.

## Status
Accepted
