## ADR: Decision to Use AWS S3 and Firebase for Storage
## Context
Our platform needs a reliable way to store and serve large amounts of audiobook and podcast content. The storage system must be scalable, and capable of handling high user traffic. Additionally, it should support fast access and integration with our backend services.

## Decision
We chose AWS S3 as our primary storage solution and Firebase Storage as a secondary option, mainly for mobile users.

## Justification
Scalability: AWS S3 can handle unlimited storage and high traffic without performance issues.

Reliability: Data is stored across multiple regions, reducing the risk of data loss.

Integration: AWS S3 integrates well with our backend and supports CDN caching for faster access.

Firebase Storage: Useful for mobile users due to its optimized real-time access and built-in authentication.

## Consequences
## Pros:
High Availability: Ensures data is always accessible, even if one storage node fails.

Security: Supports encryption and access control, preventing unauthorized access.

Global Access: Allows users to stream content from anywhere with minimal delay.

## Cons:
Latency for Large Files: AWS S3 might introduce slight delays for large file retrievals unless optimized.

Storage Costs: Expenses increase as more content is uploaded, requiring cost monitoring.

Firebase Limitations: Firebase has storage limits and might not be as cost-effective for high-bandwidth use cases.

## Status
Accepted
