## ADR: Caching Strategy
## Context
Our system needs to be fast and responsive, especially for streaming and loading content. If we fetch everything from the database every time, it will slow things down and put too much load on the database.

## Decision
We will use Redis to cache frequently used data like:

Popular books and podcasts.
Streaming session data.
User login sessions.

## Justification
Faster Performance – Redis stores data in memory, so it’s much quicker than always querying the database.

Less Load on the Database – Reduces the number of times we need to fetch the same data.

Temporary Storage – Helps with keeping user sessions active and improves streaming speed.

## Alternatives Considered
Memcached – Good for simple caching but doesn’t have as many features as Redis.

Database-level caching – Works, but not as fast.

## Consequences
We need to make sure cached data doesn’t become outdated.

Redis needs to be set up and monitored.
